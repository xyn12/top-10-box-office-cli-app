# Top10BoxOffice

This Ruby Gem will show you the current top 10 movies at the box office. It will show you how much the movies took in for the weekend, the total gross, and how many weeks it has been in the top 10. Additionally, it will also show you a basic summary of each movie on the list.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'top_10_box_office'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install top_10_box_office

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
